first project i did with someone else to help them grasp the basics, fairly safe and error-less. doesn't support multiple clients but you could easily implement that using threads.

you `nc localhost ...` and say whatever and if it's in the `message_map` it'll respond with the assigned value else it'll respond with a default response.
